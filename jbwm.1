.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jbwm
is a minimalist window manager forked from evilwm, adding basic titlebar
support, simpler key bindings, and various code cleanups and size
reductions.  evilwm is based on aewm, extended to feature
many keyboard controls, and otherwise altered to be more friendly.
.PP
In
.BR jbwm ,
the focus follows the mouse pointer, and focus is not lost if
you stray onto the root window. 
.PP
You can use the mouse to manipulate windows either by click/dragging
the 1 pixel border, or by holding down Windows/Meta and doing so anywhere 
in the client window. The controls are:
.IP "Button 1"
Move or raise window.
.IP "Button 2"
Lower window.
.IP "Button 3"
Resize window.
.PP
Most keyboard controls are used by holding down Windows/Meta, then
pressing a key. Available functions are:
.IP Escape
Exit jbwm.
.IP Return
Spawn new terminal.
.IP q
Delete current window.
.IP "Down Arrow"
Lower current window.
.IP "Up Arrow"
Lower current window.
.IP "H, J, K, L"
Move window left, down, up or right.  Holding Shift resizes the
window instead.
.IP Space
Maximise current window (toggle).
.PP
If compiled with virtual desktop support, these functions are also available: 
.IP F
Fix or unfix current window.
.IP "1--0"
Switch virtual desktop.
.IP Left
Previous virtual desktop.
.IP Right
Next virtual desktop.
.PP
In addition to the above, Windows/Meta+Tab can be used 
to cycle through windows on screen.

.SH OPTIONS
Command line arguments are accepted if jbwm was compiled with ARGV enabled
in its Makefile.  
The
.B \-A
option takes a WM_CLASS value as its argument.  Then, windows matching
the WM_CLASS can be given a default geometry with the
.B \-g
option.  
Valid modifier values for the 
.B \-1 
and 
.B \-2 
options are 
control, alt, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, mod5.
.B \-V
displays the jbwm version number.  

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP DISPLAY
DISPLAY should be set, otherwise default of :0 will be used.  

.SH BUGS
EWMH support not implemented.  More complete support of MWM hints is needed.
