Required for 1.0.0 release:

   * Stability.
   * Must build for all combinations of optional features.
   * Would be nice to keep the stripped, 32-bit x86 and SPARC binaries
     under 32K for no justifiable reason (I'm well aware this has no
     bearing on resident size).

Things to put off until 1.1.x:

   * EWMH compliance, including:
        + Client control via root window messages.
        + Client ordering maintained bearing in mind _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE.
     I already have some work towards this.
   * A few things can probably cease to be compile-time options.
   * Better interoperation with Xinerama (David Flynn has some patches
     for this).
   * Configuration file, possibly replacing most command-line options.
   * Option for new windows to tile as well as possible.
   * 64K limit?  Storage is getting cheaper these days, after all.
